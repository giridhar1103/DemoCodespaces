# DemoCodespaces
This is a demo of a sample codespaces repo and how to create it.

Install the Github CodeSpaces in the VS code extentions marketplace. Then create a codespace and add a repository to it (where data will be stored). Next, click on the three lines in the codespaces and click on open in VS Code. This will redirect you to the VS code on your local machine and you can access your codespaces from there.
